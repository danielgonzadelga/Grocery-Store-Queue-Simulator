# Grocery-Store-Queue-Simulator
The provided C++ code is designed to simulate the operation of a grocery store queue system. It models the behavior of multiple registers and customers, allowing the simulation to operate in two modes: "single" or "multiple" queues. The main functionality includes opening and closing registers, adding customers to the simulation, and handling customer departures based on different criteria. Customers are either added to a single virtual queue or to the register with the fewest items, depending on the simulation mode. The code captures the passage of time during the simulation and keeps track of important statistics, such as maximum wait time, average wait time, and the standard deviation of wait times. Users interact with the simulation by entering commands, and the program outputs relevant information about the simulated grocery store operations, providing insights into customer queue dynamics and overall system performance.
